    components of 384-610, so the hull's correct faces outvote it ~1000:1 and
    the deck stays inverted (you fall through the front of the chargen ship).

    It is also blind for a different reason — the deck is a ZERO-THICKNESS
    double-sided sheet in the render mesh, so its up skin and down skin share
    a plane (measured mean z 3.6533 vs 3.6787).  Step 2 weights votes by
    1/distance, so the coincident down skin scores ~200000 against the real
    walkable skin's ~33 and "nearest face wins" picks the wrong one.

    So this step asks the question that actually matters for a floor, and asks
    it PER TRIANGLE: of the render faces COINCIDENT with this down-facing
    collision face, which way does the nearest one point?  Coincident, not
    merely nearby — the render face has to BE this surface for its normal to
    settle the question, which is what makes the double-sided sheet decidable
    (the true skin sits ~0.004 away, any other surface is 0.2+).  A face with
    no coincident render skin is a genuine underside/overhang and is left
    alone.  On exUdeUship this flips the 6 foredeck faces the player falls
    through and leaves the other 357 down-facing faces untouched.

    Measured on exUdeUship by downward raycast (the engine's own test):
    fall-through cells 10 -> 0, walkable 92 -> 102.  Vanilla control sweeps
    (400 architecture + 400 dungeon + 61 ship meshes) report 0 regressions.

    reversal strictly alternates along the packed triangle order, and 97% of

    That makes the repair a structural problem, not a guessing problem.

    STEP 1 — relative orientation (exact, no thresholds).
        Triangles sharing an edge must traverse it in opposite directions.
        BFS the shared-edge graph and flip whatever disagrees.  This undoes
        the dropped parity exactly and is completely inert on correctly wound
        input, so vanilla strip meshes pass through untouched.

    STEP 2 — absolute sign (only where step 1 cannot help).
        Step 1 makes a component self-consistent but cannot tell an outward
        surface from an inside-out one, because flipping every triangle of a
        component is also self-consistent.  A uniformly reversed floor
        (Morrowind_ob's inuhlaaluuroomuside) needs an absolute reference:

          * a CLOSED component must enclose positive volume;
          * otherwise the render mesh decides — the artist's visual winding is
            correct by construction, so collision facing opposite a co-located
            visual face is reversed.

        The visual vote requires a quorum: at least half the component's
        triangles must have seen a qualifying visual face.  Every false
        positive measured on already-correct vanilla collision came from a
        single stray facet (typically the far skin of a thin slab — an altar
        top, a shelf, a step tread) condemning a whole component; the quorum
        removes those while still deciding genuinely reversed surfaces, whose
        own render skin covers every triangle they have.

        Where neither test is decisive the component is left alone.  A lone
        down-facing surface is a perfectly valid ceiling or overhang, and
        flipping it would punch a new hole.

    Measured against the Oblivion originals (dungeons + architecture, 265
    meshes / 64k matched triangles): 99.8% of reversed triangles repaired,
    0.08% of already-correct triangles disturbed.  The previous heuristic
    (near-horizontal + coplanar-conflict + nearest-visual-face arbitration)
    scored 35.8% recall on the same corpus and left priorychapelinterior,
    skbridgesmall and rockgreatforest645lichen unwalkable.

    Gated by the collision winding-fix toggle (see collision_options): the
    damage this repairs is specific to plugins that re-export collision as
    flattened triangle lists, so the repair is opt-in per plugin rather than
    always-on.  Vanilla-authored collision skips it entirely.

    #     nodes: a keyframed body with anim flags (137/142) on a non-animated
    #     object flips the engine into the baked/anim-static path and the
    #     whole compound acts welded solid.
    #  2. mass>0 AND owns a constraint (mace-trap chain links: Oblivion holds
    #     whole traps keyframed until the trap script enables havok) →
    #     DYNAMIC, like vanilla trapmace01's links (ms=3, quality 4).
    #  3. Everything else (constrained-island anchors: cellchain01 root,
    #     cellChainMiddle, mass=100 "Unyielding"; unyielding props) →
    #     STATIC with mass 0.  Vanilla chain/noose/trap anchors are ALWAYS
    #     static mass-0 bodies (NooseRopePiece01 root, trapmace Base01),
    #     never keyframed.
    #  4. BREAKAWAY pieces (mwallplankbreakaway01's 8 planks, IDCrumbleWall01's
    #     bricks): ms=6 bodies with real mass whose clip only creaks them off
    #     their mounting -- 15.19 deg and ZERO translation keys for the planks
    #     -- because the visible break is HAVOK taking over and letting the
    #     pieces detach and FALL.  Forcing those onto the plain keyframed path
    #     (which also zeroes the mass) pinned them forever: the clip played, the
    #     planks tilted, and then hung in the half-broken pose as a solid wall.
    #     Gates/portcullises are also ms=6 with mass but sit on the anim-static
    #     layers, so the authored OL_PROPS layer separates the two.
    #
    #     A breakaway piece still ships KEYFRAMED, exactly like Oblivion's
    #     `Unyielding = 1` (all 8 planks; the root is Unyielding 0 / mass 0):
    #     the body is HELD, following the clip, and only becomes dynamic when
    #     the animation ends.  Shipping it dynamic instead made the planks drop
    #     the instant the cell loaded, before the clip ever played.  What the
    #     breakaway flag changes is that the piece KEEPS ITS MASS, so the
    #     script-side release (ObjectReference.SetMotionType(Motion_Dynamic))
    #     hands Havok a body that can actually fall -- a mass-0 body would just
    #     hang there.  See script_convert PlayGroup handling.
    #  5. HELD TRAP islands (ctrapswingmacelong01's chain + mace,
    #     ctraplogs01's logs, cprollingrock01): ms=6 bodies with real mass
    #     that belong to a CONSTRAINED island.  Case 2 shipped these DYNAMIC,
    #     which is what made every swinging trap swing freely the moment the
    #     cell loaded, before anything tripped it.  Oblivion's own trap script
    #     states the contract in its header comment -- "On activation havok
    #     will turn on and logs will roll" (CTrapLogs01SCRIPT) -- and authors
    #     the whole island `Unyielding = 1`: the trap is HELD rigid until the
    #     trap script fires, exactly like a breakaway piece.
    #
    #     So a constrained trap island is a breakaway: ship it KEYFRAMED (held,
    #     not simulating) but KEEP the authored mass, and let the script-side
    #     SetMotionType(Motion_Dynamic) release start the swing.  Skyrim's own
    #     trapmace01 ships its links dynamic because a Skyrim trap has no
    #     script-held phase; ours must reproduce Oblivion's held phase instead.
    # A held piece must ALSO be animated to ship keyframed.  Keyframed implies
    # the D_ANIMATED collision flags (137) set below, and CLAUDE.md records the
    # rule this violated: "a keyframed body with anim flags on a non-animated
    # object flips the engine into the baked path and the whole compound acts
    # welded solid".  ctraplogs01 has 6 bodies of which only 1 is animated, and
    # ctrapcavein01 has 24 of which 2 are not -- shipping those non-animated
    # ones keyframed froze the cell on load in Vilverin.
    #
    # A non-animated held piece is still HELD, just by the static branch (mass
    # 0, ms=5).  It cannot be released to fall, which is the honest outcome:
    # Oblivion moved it with its engine-side trap system, not with a clip.
    #
    # A CONSTRAINED island is the exception: its links are held rigid by the
    # constraint solver, not by a clip, so they never needed anim flags.  Those
    # keep the old behaviour (mass retained, released by the script) because
    # that is the in-game-confirmed swinging-trap fix.

    NIF matrices act on row vectors under PyFFI's m_ij naming; the engine
    (and NifSkope) reads the same file bytes as a column-vector matrix, so the
    column matrix is the m_ij-named transpose.  bhkRigidBody(T) translation is
    in Oblivion Havok units at this stage (game / 7); the Skyrim rescale
    (× _HAVOK_SCALE) happens later in _convert_collision.

    bhkRigidBody (non-T) carries no transform of its own, so it is promoted to
    bhkRigidBodyT (identical field layout — PyFFI class swap) to hold L.
    Returns True if the body was modified.

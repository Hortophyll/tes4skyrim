"""Boolean polygon union of the corridor ribbons, then retriangulation.

WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT ALGORITHM

Corridor ribbons overlap wherever pathgrid lines converge.  Cutting them
pairwise (trim the ribbon, weld the seam, patch the junction) is an
approximation that has to get every case right — end-to-end, crossing, wedge,
collinear, dead end — and any case it gets wrong shows up as either lost ground
or stacked sheets.

The union does not approximate.  Each ribbon is a polygon; the geometric union
of the polygons is a region whose area is EXACTLY the measure of the ground the
corridors cover.  Retriangulating that region produces triangles that are
non-overlapping by definition.  So:

    coverage  == 100% by construction (the union contains every ribbon)
    overlap   ==   0% by construction (a triangulation does not self-overlap)

STOREYS — one union PER SHEET, never one flattened union

A single 2D union of every ribbon is WRONG for a multi-storey building, because
the floors overlap in plan view — measured in ChorrolFightersGuild, the three
floors overlap each other by 26-36% of the union's area.  Flattening them and
triangulating once lets a triangle take one corner from the upper floor and
another from the lower: a near-vertical sheet hanging in the stairwell, which is
what rendered as "triangles between floors".  Neither emitting those (mid-air
mesh) nor dropping them (they severed 24 shared edges and split one floor into
7 pieces) is a fix, because the flattened polygon was never the right region.

So the ribbons are partitioned into SHEETS first, and each sheet is unioned and
triangulated on its own:

  1. `_storey_groups` joins ribbons that share a pathgrid NODE where their
     heights agree.  A staircase therefore joins the floor at its foot AND the
     floor at its head, so a whole building comes back as one connected group —
     correct for connectivity, but still not a region we can union.
  2. `_split_plan_overlaps` cuts that group into sheets that do not overlap
     THEMSELVES in plan: two ribbons that overlap in plan and disagree in height
     by more than STOREY_GAP_Z cannot share a sheet.  Ribbons are then assigned
     to the sheet whose height they match BEST (a first-fit scattered one floor
     across several sheets, which overlapped at the same height and duplicated
     ground — 7% of triangles stacked).
  3. Each sheet is unioned, triangulated, and lifted independently, then
     `_weld_sheets` (3D radius weld) and `_split_t_junctions` rejoin sheets that
     abut on one floor, so the surface stays connected across a sheet boundary.

HEIGHT — the vertex, not the triangle, owns it

Every output vertex gets its Z from a corridor that covers it, along that
corridor's own centreline, so each triangle sits on the pathgrid line's own
slope (principle 2) and a staircase keeps its rise.

Crucially the height is a property of THE POINT AND ITS STOREY, never of
whichever triangle reached it first.  The original code took a triangle's height
as the MEAN of its three corners' levels and then bound each corner to any vertex
already within SAME_SURFACE_Z of that mean, so a corner's height depended on
triangle order: corner 22 of ICPrisonSewerExit01, carrying a single level at
395.3, minted one vertex at 395.3 for one neighbour and another at 356.2 for the
next.  Those two triangles then shared no EDGE, and the engine cannot walk
between triangles that share only a point — 28 of 582 shared edges were lost and
the mesh fell into 12 components (ICPrisonEntrance01: 28).  Stairs tore worst
because every consecutive triangle on a flight has a different mean.  No value of
SAME_SURFACE_Z fixes that; it is a first-match-wins race, not a tolerance.

`_emit_surfaces` instead keys each vertex on (corner, storey band), a stable
per-corner identity, so two triangles meeting on one surface ALWAYS resolve to
the same vertex and connectivity is structural.

DOORS

corridor_doors.door_footprints runs first, on the raw ribbon union; each door's
flat footprint (the quad bridging its base line to the nearest corridor edge) is
handed back as an `extra_strips` polygon and joins the union as ordinary ground,
and its BASE LINE is passed as a `door_edges` constraint so the retriangulation
forces one large triangle with its long side on the door line — the vanilla
Skyrim door triangle.  The union resolves any overlap with the corridor by
construction — the door coverage is preserved exactly, nothing is deleted.

HEIGHT

Every output vertex gets its Z from a corridor that covers it, along that
corridor's own centreline, so each triangle sits on the pathgrid line's own
slope (principle 2) and a staircase keeps its rise.  Heights are never discarded
and reconstructed — each ribbon already knows its Z everywhere along itself.

    Returns (verts2d, tris).  The old approach earcut'd the polygon after
    cutting it on an 8u grid, which produced a mesh full of needles and tiny
    slivers along every boundary (20% of triangles had an edge ratio > 3, some
    > 400).  Vanilla Skyrim navmeshes are near-uniform ~target_edge triangles,
    so we reproduce that:

      1. Sample interior Steiner points on a hex lattice at `target_edge`
         spacing — a hex lattice, not a square grid, so the Delaunay of the
         points is near-equilateral (the Voronoi-dual pattern the author asked
         for) instead of right-isoceles.
      2. Densify the boundary rings at the same spacing so boundary triangles
         are the same scale as interior ones.
      3. Delaunay-triangulate the whole point set, then keep only triangles
         whose CENTROID lies inside the polygon — this honours the outline and
         every hole exactly (a ring of corridors around an obstacle keeps its
         hole) without a constrained triangulator.

    `fixed_edges` is a list of (p0, p1) 2D segments that MUST appear as a
    triangle edge — the door base lines.  Their endpoints are inserted as
    Steiner points and no interior sample is placed near the segment, so the
    Delaunay naturally forms a triangle with that long edge (Skyrim's door
    triangle).

    `steep_seeds` is a list of (x, y) points along STEEP ribbon centrelines
    (stairs, ramps).  A uniform target_edge triangle on a staircase climbs more
    than one storey gap across its corners and is dropped by the per-surface
    emission — the whole stair vanishes.  These seeds are forced in at a fine
    spacing so the stair keeps short, gently-climbing triangles that survive.

    connected surface.

    The pathgrid is the one input that asserts where an actor walks, so two
    edges meeting at a node describe a junction an actor walks through.  The
    navmesh must therefore be walkable across it — not merely present on both
    sides.

    Everything upstream tries to arrange this and can each fail for its own
    reason: the sheet split can put the two corridors in different sheets (a
    staircase genuinely conflicts with the floor it passes UNDER, so no scoring
    keeps it with the landing it arrives at); the clip can then take the
    junction ground as "duplicate"; the 3D weld only fuses vertices that already
    coincide; and a bridge triangle cannot be laid where the surrounding fan is
    already closed.  Measured on AnvilPinarusInventiusHouse the result was a
    flight whose top row sat ~32u BELOW its landing at nearly the same XY (v120
    (-255.8,132.9,36.8) vs v80 (-255.4,134.9,68.6)), joined only by skew edges
    hanging off a vertex 61u to the SIDE: 191.7u of joint at the top of the
    flight against 686.4u at its bottom.  One component, so no invariant caught
    it — and in game the navmesh at the top of the stairs did not connect.

    So this pass does not try to prevent the split; it repairs it afterwards,
    unconditionally, at every node:

      1. Collect the mesh vertices within the node's own corridor half-width.
      2. Group them by SURFACE (heights within one MAX_CLIMB step are the same
         walkable level, so a stair top and its landing are one group while a
         floor two storeys down is not).
      3. Where a group holds vertices from two or more edge-connected
         components, weld them onto the single vertex nearest the node.

    Welding — rather than adding triangles — is what makes this total: it needs
    no border edge, cannot raise an edge above two owners, and cannot invent
    ground.  Triangles that collapse to a degenerate are dropped, which is
    exactly the duplicate sliver at the seam.

    A pathgrid node shared by two sheets is a staircase top or bottom — the one

    triangles fan around it and share no edge, and NVNM adjacency links only
    across shared edges, so the mesh stays in two components with the break
    exactly at the top of the stairs (measured on Pinarus: v152, both components
    present, gap 0.000u, still disconnected).

    At each such node this bridges the two sides directly: take a border edge from
    each component incident to the node and emit the triangle joining them.  That
    single triangle shares one full edge with each side, so the two components
    become one.  Only border edges AT the node are used, and only between

    THE DEFECT THIS REPLACES.  The old code chose a triangle's height as the
    MEAN of its three corners' levels, then bound each corner to whatever vertex
    already sat within SAME_SURFACE_Z of that mean.  A corner's height therefore
    depended on WHICH TRIANGLE ASKED FIRST, so two triangles sharing a corner on
    ONE surface routinely bound it to two different vertices:

        corner 22, a single level at 395.3, minted vertex 370 (z=395.3) for one
        neighbour and vertex 413 (z=356.2) for the next.

    They then share no EDGE, and the engine cannot walk between them
    (_compute_adjacency links only across shared edges).  On a STAIR every
    consecutive triangle has a different mean, so stairs tore worst: measured on
    ICPrisonSewerExit01, 28 of 582 shared 2D edges were lost and the mesh fell
    into 12 components; ICPrisonEntrance01 fell into 28.  No value of
    SAME_SURFACE_Z fixes it — widening fuses real storeys, narrowing tears more.
    It is a first-match-wins race, not a tolerance.

    THE FIX.  A point's height is a property of THE POINT AND ITS SURFACE, never
    of whichever triangle reached it first:

      1. Assign every 2D triangle to the surfaces beneath it (unchanged: cluster
         the corners' levels on STOREY_GAP_Z, emit once per storey).
      2. UNION-FIND the (corner, surface) pairs.  When a triangle is emitted on a
         surface, its three corners are joined into one class.  Two triangles
         meeting on one surface therefore ALWAYS resolve their shared corner to
         the same class — connectivity is structural, exactly as it is for the
         2D union itself, instead of being re-derived per triangle.
      3. Give each class ONE height: the level at that corner nearest the class's
         own surface.  Because the level came from the ribbon's own centreline
         (_height_on follows the pathgrid line A->B), the lifted surface is
         PARALLEL TO THE SEED LINE by construction — a stair comes out as one
         straight ramp rather than a sawtooth of per-triangle averages.

    Coverage is untouched: every 2D triangle is still emitted on every surface
    beneath it, and no triangle is ever dropped.

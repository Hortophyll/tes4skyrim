"""Cleanup + validation for the corridor navmesh.

Two jobs, both mandatory for a mesh the engine can actually walk:

  * DROP DEGENERATE triangles (no XY footprint) — a vertical sliver covers no
    ground, so no actor stands on it, and a coplanar antiparallel pair reads as
    CK OPPOSITE_NORMALS.
  * MAKE MANIFOLD — NVNM adjacency (pgrd_to_navm._compute_adjacency) links an
    edge only when EXACTLY two triangles share it; an edge shared by three or
    more links NONE of them, silently disconnecting everything around it.  The
    ribbon body is manifold by construction, but the door-quad connection can
    lay a triangle over one already there, so this is the backstop.

The corridor model needs NOTHING else: no welding (ribbon vertices are shared
by construction), no stitching, no island cull (there are no stray scraps).

    Oblivion expressed a drop-down as two disconnected pathgrid islands — the
    actor steps off a ledge, and there is no pathgrid edge for that.  The
    navmesh mirrors the pathgrid, so those storeys arrive as separate
    components and an NPC pathing across has no route.

    Skyrim's own mechanism for this is an NVNM **Edge Link** of type
    `Ledge Down` (2) from the upper triangle and `Ledge Up` (1) from the lower
    one — NOT geometry.  Vanilla Skyrim.esm carries 476 Ledge Down and 467
    Ledge Up links across 3,000 navmeshes (near-symmetric pairs), and zero
    bridging triangles: an actor DROPS through empty space, so inventing
    walkable ground across the lip both lets NPCs walk on air and, because the
    quad is near-vertical, breeds downfacing/opposite-normal triangles.

    This only DETECTS the pairs; `pgrd_to_navm` writes the links.  Both sides
    must ALREADY be separate components, which is what keeps it safe: stairs,
    ramps and genuinely-connected storeys are one component and never reach
    here.  A pair qualifies only when its boundaries come within
    ISLAND_BRIDGE_XY in plan AND are separated by a drop between
    ISLAND_BRIDGE_MIN_DROP and ISLAND_BRIDGE_MAX_DROP, so a fall the actor
    cannot survive is left alone.

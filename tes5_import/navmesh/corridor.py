"""Phase-1 corridor-ribbon navmesh generation.

THE MODEL, in one line:

    THE PATHGRID IS THE MESH.

Bethesda's pathgrid is the only part of the input that ASSERTS "an actor walks
here".  Instead of re-discovering walkable surface from collision (voxelize /
contour / region-flood) and then fighting to keep the result connected across
the seams that discovery introduces, we build the navmesh DIRECTLY on the
pathgrid: a flat, fixed-width ribbon of triangles centred on every pathgrid
edge.

Ribbons on a dense pathgrid overlap heavily (a node can carry 9 edges, and a
median edge is shorter than two ribbon widths), so they are not simply laid on
top of each other: corridor_union takes the boolean UNION of the ribbon polygons
and retriangulates it, per walkable surface.  The union is coverage-preserving
and non-overlapping by construction (see corridor_union), so the result is a
single connected sheet covering the pathgrid with zero stacked triangles.

The result is deliberately SPARSE — a corridor an actor can follow, not a
room-filling floor.  A completely functional, zero-bad-triangle navmesh that is
a bit narrow beats a dense one that is broken.  Width-grow (fill out to the
walls) is a later phase; this one gets the corridors + doors + links right.

Design principles (see docs/navmesh_corridor_redesign.md):
  1. The pathgrid CENTERLINE is sacred — never cut or moved, even where it
     clips a wall.  Only grown width (a later phase) may ever be clipped.
  2. Downward snap follows the pathgrid LINE'S OWN SLOPE.  A pathgrid edge
     A->B already IS the walk ramp (Oblivion places stair nodes at tread
     level).  We sit the ribbon on that straight line and only ever push a
     cross-section DOWN onto collision when the line floats above it — never
     let jagged treads push it up and reintroduce a sawtooth.  Slope stays
     slope.  Phase 1 keeps the corridor FLAT across its width.
  3. Conservative: when unsure, stop.  Doorways are assumed to already have
     pathgrid through them.

Output contract (identical to the old build_navmesh): a manifold (verts, tris)
where every edge is shared by <= 2 triangles — a 3+-shared edge silently
disconnects everything around it under _compute_adjacency.

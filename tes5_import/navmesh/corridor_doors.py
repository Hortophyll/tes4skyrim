r"""Compute a Door footprint at every door, to feed the corridor union.

Vanilla Skyrim marks a door with a triangle whose LONG EDGE runs PARALLEL to the
door line.  We reproduce that: for each door we find the base line (BL-BR, on the
door line) and the FOOTPRINT quad bridging it to the nearest corridor edge:

    BL ----------- BR      BL,BR = the door base, on the door line,
     |             |       DOOR_LINE_HALF either side of the (panel-centred)
     |             |       threshold.  BL-BR is the LONG SIDE handed to the
     |             |       triangulation as a forced edge.
     E0 ----------- E1     E0,E1 = the two ends of the nearest corridor edge,
                           ordered so E0 pairs with BL and E1 with BR.

`door_footprints` returns, per reachable door, the base line and the quad
BL-BR-E1-E0.  corridor.py feeds the quad into the boolean union as ordinary
ground and passes the base line as a union `door_edges` constraint, so the
retriangulation forms ONE large triangle with its long side on the door line —
the union owns and de-overlaps the door geometry, no separate stitching.

Conservative: a door whose nearest corridor edge midpoint is beyond
DOOR_BRIDGE_RADIUS is walled off from the pathgrid and yields nothing.
